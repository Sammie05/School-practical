Why we use c++                                                                                              Because of the versatility it serves as a basic                                                                                                                                                                         Note:1) C-compilre used to translate lines of code to the machine understanding                                     you will use window text editor                                                                                                                                                                                         basic of writing programme                                                                          1) C- Headerfiles: it combines c-libraries with in built functions, the functions and syntax for c-programming are pre-defined

<stdio.h> - standard input output header file
<stdlib.h> - standard utility
<setdmp.h>
<signal.h>
<stdarg.h>
<math.h>
<ctype.h>

2) main method/main function: this is where the code are executed.
 any quote must end in a semicolon (;)

variable: A variable is a container used to store pieces of information.

3) DataType: integer (%d)
             float, double - Decimal
             short decimal No , long decimal number
             (%f)                       (%lf)
                                                  

b) character data: single character (%c)
                   string (more character) - (%s)

4) functions
* print function it is used to display an output to the screene.
5)Escape sequence: used to style your programming
        Newline = \n
        Horizontal tab = \t

Empty Space: they are non executable statement used to arrange our code for clarity
1) Single line comment (//)
   multiple lines comment(/* */)
it is used for debugging.

Constants: they are unchanged entities

declaration - The variable used are declared
arithmetic -
control - conditional statement.

Scanf () : it is used to allow users to make choice of input
ampasand: it is used to access the address of a variable in the memory location
fget
